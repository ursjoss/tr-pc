        <h2>Email</h2>
        <p>
            The fields to be set-up are similar as the ones used to set-up a new email account
            on your email application.  These values are used by the <a href="email.html">Retrieve Email function</a>.
        </p>
        <p>You can specify whether your email should be fetched automatically at startup and at regular intervals.</p>
        <p>You can specify whether your fetched email should be kept or removed from the server.</p>
        <p>You can specify whether your email attachments should be saved and linked to from the notes field. If this is the case, you
        can specify a folder to save the files. If no folder is entered the files will be saved in your user home folder.</p>
        <p>Please note that this function does NOT work if you have a proxy server. This is a restriction due to JavaMail.</p>
